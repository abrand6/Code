# Party Pinball

All the codes for 2017 GIZMO team 8 are shared here


## Arduino_FSR

The Arduino_FSR file contains the code for the Arduino that controls all force sensitive resistors. When a FSR is triggered, the ID of the FSR will be sent to the RPI.

## RPI

The RPI file contains the code for the Raspberry PI that is connected with the Arduino_FSR. It reads the signal from the Arduino and executes the music files accordingly.
